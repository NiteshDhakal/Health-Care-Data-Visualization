# Health-Care-Data-Visualization
PowerBI Dashboard For Health Department


This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard developed for the Health Department to explore key operational metrics such as patient volumes, cancellations, staffing levels, overtime, and financial performance. The visualizations aim to support data-driven decision-making around inpatient service planning and resource allocation.

## Preview
A PDF version of the report is available in this repository for a quick preview:

## Purpose

This Power BI project is part of a larger initiative to analyse and simulate operational strategies in healthcare settings. It enables:

- Enhanced visibility into service utilisation and workforce demands
- Easier identification of trends, outliers, and cost pressures
- A foundation for further simulation and modelling (e.g., in Python or Streamlit)

- ## Tools Used
- **PowerBI Desktop** to visualise data
- **Python** to generate dummy data
- **Pandas and other libraries** to clean, transform and manipulate data (very basic work done at this stage)

- ## Future Work
- This is the data visualization module of a broader analytics project. Next steps include:

- Integrating simulation models (e.g., using Python or Streamlit)
- Forecasting patient demand and budget scenarios
- Automating data refresh from source systems

- *Disclaimer: This dashboard uses sample or anonymised data for demonstration purposes only.*
